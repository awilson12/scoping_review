The most frequently reported disinfectants were alcohol (weekly use: 39%), bleach (22%) and sprays (20%). More nurses were classified as highly exposed by JTEM (alcohol 41%, sprays 41%, bleach 34%) than by JEM (21%, 30%, 26%, respectively). Agreement between JEM and JTEM was fair-to-moderate (kappa: 0.3–0.5) for most disinfectants. JEM and JTEM exposure estimates were heterogeneous in most nursing jobs, except in emergency room and education/administration.","From the Results section (page 6):
Fifty-four percent of nurses reported that they cleaned surfaces with disinfectants weekly, while 21% cleaned instruments with disinfectants weekly. Fifty-five percent of nurses reported using at least one of the 14 specific disinfectants weekly, 11% used them at least 1 hour per day and 20% performed only administrative tasks (Table 1). Across nursing jobs, the percentage of nurses using disinfectants 4–7 days/week ranged from 5% to 48%, while weekly use ranged from 19% to 88% (Table E3). Nurses in the emergency room, operating room and intensive care unit more often used disinfectants weekly to clean instruments or surfaces (>80%), as compared to other nursing jobs.",No,N/A,N/A,No,N/A,N/A,Yes,"From the Methods section (page 4):
The “job-task” axis of the JTEM included the 24 possible combinations of 8 types of nursing jobs by 3 categories of cleaning tasks (surfaces only, at least instruments, none). For the exposure axis of the JEM and JTEM, the 14 disinfectants and the general use of sprays were considered. However, only 7 disinfectants for which at least 10% of the nurses in at least one nursing job reported weekly exposure (alcohol, hypochlorite bleach, peroxide bleach, glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium compounds, enzymatic cleaners, formaldehyde), and sprays, were retained. The other 7 disinfectants (acetic acid, ammonia, chloramine T, ethylene oxide, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics) were grouped together as “other” (with requirement of exposure to at least one of these agents) since less than 10% of the women reported exposure, regardless of the nursing job.",Yes,No,N/A,No,,No,,No,N/A,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,,N/A

Participants were monitored for one to
three shifts over a period of 1 week (LeBouf et al., 2014;
Saito et al., 2015). Mobile-area and personal samples
were collected using 6-l and 0.4-l Silonite™-evacuated
canisters, respectively (Entech Instruments, Inc., Simi
Valley, CA), with an inlet tube near the workers’ breathing
zone for the latter samples. Additionally, to estimate
background VOC levels, a total of 22 daily ambient air
samples were collected using the 6-l Silonite™-evacuated
canisters placed outside the hospital and away from
automobile traffic on each day of sampling. During VOC
sampling, systematic observations of participants were
conducted by trained technicians using standardized
data collection forms to record information at 5-min
intervals on tasks, activities, materials or products used
and their amounts (low, high), work location, engineering
controls, and personal protective equipment use,
including cleaning tasks and product use by other workers
in the same area (‘secondhand exposure’).
The analytical method targeted 14 specific VOCs
(ethanol, acetone, 2-propanol, methylene chloride, hexane,
chloroform, benzene, methyl-methacrylate, toluene,
ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, α-pinene,
and d-limonene) based on a pilot study done at one
of the three VA hospital as previously described by
LeBouf (2012). The percentage of measurements below
the limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 84.6%
(α-pinene in personal samples) to 0% (acetone and toluene
in personal, and acetone in mobile-area samples).
Measurements below the LODs were replaced by imputations,
which were randomly simulated from 0 to the
corresponding LODs (Ganser and Hewett, 2010).","From the Results section of the Abstract:
Cluster analysis identified eight task/product-use clusters that were distributed across multiple occupations and hospital units, with the exception of clusters consisting of housekeepers and floor strippers/waxers. Results of the mixed-effect models showed significant associations between selected VOC exposures and several clusters, combinations of IH-generated task groups and chemical ingredients, and product application groups. The patient/personal cleaning task using products containing chlorine was associated with elevated levels of personal chloroform and α-pinene exposures.
Tasks associated with instrument sterilizing and disinfecting were significantly associated with personal d-limonene and 2-propanol exposures. Surface and floor cleaning and stripping tasks were predominated by housekeepers and floor strippers/waxers, and use of chlorine-, alcohol-, ethanolamine-, and quaternary ammonium compounds-based products was associated with exposures to chloroform, α-pinene, acetone, 2-propanol, or d-limonene.",No,,,No,N/A,N/A,No,N/A,N/A,Yes,"From the Methods section (page 854):
